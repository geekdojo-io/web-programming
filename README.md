## Week 1 - Introduction to Network & History of Internet

- Homework: Write a research paper about what happens when you type an URL (example: www.google.com) in a web browser and press enter.

---

## Week 2 - Introduction to Network & History of Internet (Cont.)

- Homework: Write a research paper on an IP address. Topics should cover:
    - What is IP address (IPv4)?
    - What is subnetting?
    - What are private addresses?
    - What is a dynamic IP address?
    - What is port 53 used for?

## Week 3 & Week 4 - Python / Flask Programming with Http Request and Response

### Linux commands
#### Brief list of linux commands
| Command  | Description  | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `mkdir`  | Make directory   | `$ mkdir py_hello` |
| `pwd`    | Display the current directory | `$ pwd` |
| `ls`     | List files in the current directory | `$ ls` |
| `cd`     | Create a directory | `$ cd home` |
| `touch`  | Create an empty file if it doesn't exist. | `$ touch hello.py` |

---

### Examples of CD (Change Directory)
Go to a home directory
```
$ cd ~ 
```

Go to the SourceControl directory
```
$ cd SourceControl 
```
Move up to a parent directory (..)
```
$ cd .. 
```

Go to the root directory (/)
```
$ cd / 
``` 


#### Quiz

- Open Terminal. Create `linux_quiz` directory under the `SourceControl` directory, and create a sub directory `subdir1`, `subdir2` and `subdir3` under `linux_quiz` directory. Create `hello.txt` under `subdir2` directory. Create `README.md` under `subdir3` directory. Once all directories and files are created, type `ls -R` and press <kbd>enter</kbd> to verify the result. Here is an example of the expected behavior:
```console
$ ls -R
.:
subdir1  subdir2  subdir3

./subdir1:

./subdir2:
hello.txt

./subdir3:
README.md

```

### Flask Web Server
Flask is a simple yet powerful Python web server.

### 'Hello World' project
Open the Terminal.
Verify that you are on the home directory.

```console
$ pwd
```

Go to the SourceControl directory.

```console
$ cd SourceControl
```
Create a new project directory, 'py_hello'.

```console
$ mkdir py_hello
```

Go to the py_hello directory.

```console
$ cd py_hello
```

Install Flask.

```console
$ pip install flask --user
```

Create 'app.py' file.

```console
$ touch app.py.
```

Launch the Visual Studio Code.

```console
$ code .
```

Type the following lines of code in the app.py using the Visual Studio Code editor.
![alt text](images/py_hello.png)


From the Terminal, run $`python app.py`.

```console
$ python app.py
```

Then, open a web browser from the VM, and type `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to verify that your program is working.

Find the IP address for your VM using the following command:

```console
$ ifconfig | grep inet
```

Then, from your host (Windows), open a web browser, and type the address (Example: `http://192.168.2.101:5000`), and verify that you cannot access the app. This is because the app only allows the local connection. This diagram illustrates that:
![alt text](images/flask_access0.png)

From the Terminal, press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to kill the app.

#### Quiz

- Create `flask_quiz1` directory under the `SourceControl` directory, and create a Flask app that returns your name. Verify that it works.

### 'Hello World' project (Part 2)

To allows the access outside your VM and debugging, change Line 9 to the following:

```python
app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port="5000", debug=True)
```

So, the changed code should look like this:
![alt text](images/py_hello2.png)


From the Terminal, run $`python app.py`.

```console
$ python app.py
```

Then, open a web browser from the VM, and type `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to verify that your program is working.

From your host (Windows), open a web browser, and type the address (Example: `http://192.168.2.101:5000`), and verify that you can access the app. This diagram illustrates that:
![alt text](images/flask_access1.png)

From the Terminal, press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to kill the app.


#### Quiz

- Create `flask_quiz2` directory under the `SourceControl` directory, and create a Flask app that returns your name. Access the website from your Windows machine. Verify that it works.

---


### Routing
Use `@app.route()` to bind a function to a specific URL path.

#### Basic routing

#### Quiz

- Create `flask_quiz3` directory under the `SourceControl` directory, and copy the code inside app.py from [003_py_counter](003_py_counter/) example. Add `/reset` path which binds to a `reset()` method which resets the counter to `0`.

#### Dynamic routing
You can make the URL path dynamic by accepting a `<name>`, and pass the `name` variable as an input parameter to the method bound to the route. Here is an example:
![alt text](images/py_dynamic_routing.png)

#### Quiz
- Enhance the `flask_quiz3` by creating a path `/set/<new_counter>` which binds to a `set(new_counter)` method which sets the counter to the `new_counter` variable if the `new_counter` is an unsigned integer (non-negative integer).
