##### Anwer
3

##### Explanation
The code is using recursion. Recursion is a a method that calls itself.

- First call: foo(2, 0) # The first call was triggered by `print(foo(2, 0))`.
- Second call: foo(1, 2) # This is because 1 = 2 - 1, and 2 = 2 + 0
- Third call: foo(0, 3) # Now, because x = 0, the code will return `ans` which is 3.
